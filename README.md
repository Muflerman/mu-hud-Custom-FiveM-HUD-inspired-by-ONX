# mu-hud | Custom FiveM HUD inspired by ONX

mu-hud is my first FiveM resource, a custom HUD inspired by ONX servers (both versions).  
It provides a clean and modern interface for roleplay servers, designed to enhance player immersion and usability.  
This HUD is lightweight, easy to install, and customizable for your server’s needs.
